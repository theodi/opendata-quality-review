# Open Data Quality Review

This project is the result of a short exploratory project to explore the data quality of three UK government open datasets. 
The project is a joint exercise carried out by the Open Data Institute (ODI) and [the Experian data quality team](https://www.edq.com/uk).

The goals of the project were to:

* Identify the types of data quality issues that might occur in some existing open datasets
* Suggest common data quality checks that both publishers and users can apply to data
* Explore the idea of an "open data quality index", building on the ODIâ€™s existing work on open data certificates and benchmarking open data

The findings are available in a summary report. The data quality summaries produced during the exercise have also been published under 
an open licence so can be freely accessed, used and shared.
